description: A neobrutalist presentation system where 3px solid black borders ARE the layout. Display type runs in the native system sans-serif stack (Segoe UI / system-ui) at weight 900 in strict uppercase — no web fonts loaded. The palette is white canvas + black structure + two muted pastel accents (blush pink #F2D4CF and sage green #E5EDD6) + a neutral gray. Depth comes from hard offset shadows in solid black at 4px and 6px — never blurred, never colored. The aesthetic borrows from brutalist editorial web design and zine layout: borders meet without gaps, contrast is high but warmed by the pastel accents, and large numerals sit at very low opacity behind content as decorative wallpaper. The effect is sharp, system-native, and unmistakably digital — closer to a Notion-meets-protest-poster than a polished pitch deck.

## Frontend Slides Fixed-Stage Policy

When this design system is used by the `frontend-slides` skill, generate the final deck as a **fixed 1920×1080 stage** that scales uniformly to the browser viewport. The deck should preserve a 16:9 slide canvas on every screen, including phones; it may letterbox or pillarbox, but it should not reflow slide content for mobile.

This policy has higher priority than any source-template responsive behavior described later in this file. If a later section says the original template is viewport-fluid, treat that as source history only, not as the target generation model for `frontend-slides`.

This policy applies even if the source template was originally implemented with viewport-fluid CSS such as `100vw`, `100vh`, `vw`, `vh`, or `clamp()`. Treat those values as design proportions to translate into 1920×1080 stage coordinates, not as live responsive rules in the generated deck.

Use `deck-stage.js` or an equivalent inline stage scaler for final output: render each slide at 1920×1080, scale the whole stage with one transform, and verify rendered screenshots for both text overflow and panel overlap.


## Overview

Raw Grid is a **neobrutalist presentation system** built on a single structural premise: **3px solid black borders are the layout**. There are no margins between regions, no gaps between cells, no rounded corners, no gradients. When two regions meet, a 3px black line separates them — that line is the entire grid system.

The typeface choice is deliberately non-decorative. The system uses the **native system sans-serif stack** (`Segoe UI, system-ui, -apple-system, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`) — no Google Fonts, no web fonts, no licensing. Display text runs at weight 900 in strict uppercase with tight negative letter-spacing. Body text runs at weight 500 in sentence case. The visual contrast between heavy uppercase display and light sentence-case body is the typographic rhythm of the system. The choice of system fonts is itself an aesthetic statement: it reads as "this is software, not a print artifact" — the digital-native counterpart to the printed-zine aesthetic of most brutalist systems.

The palette has six tokens but functions in four roles. **White** (`{colors.white}`) is the canvas. **Black** (`{colors.black}`) is the structure: borders, headlines, body text, label fills, shadow color. **Pink** (`{colors.pink}` — a muted blush #F2D4CF) and **green** (`{colors.green}` — a sage celadon #E5EDD6) are the accent surfaces — warm and cool counterparts, never used on text, always used as region fills. **Gray** (`{colors.gray}` — #F5F5F5) is the neutral fill for table zebra-striping and tertiary surfaces. The pastels are pale enough that black text remains fully legible on them, which is essential: the system never inverts text color over accent surfaces.

Depth is entirely **hard offset shadow** at 6px and 4px offsets in solid black with zero blur. No `rgba(...)`, no `0 4px 12px`. Either the shadow is hard-edged solid black or there is no shadow at all.

**Density philosophy: medium.** The system uses borders to wall off regions cleanly, but each region holds restrained content — typically one display element paired with one body paragraph, or one stat paired with one caption. The borders are loud (3px solid black, no compromise); the content within each region is quiet. A slide that feels broken in this system is one where a region is *empty* or *over-stuffed*; the correct density is one substantive element per bordered region.

**Key Characteristics:**
- White (`{colors.white}`) canvas with 3px solid black (`{colors.black}`) borders dividing every region. No gaps between cells — borders meet edge-to-edge.
- System sans-serif at weight 900 uppercase for all display type; weight 500 sentence case for all body type.
- Hard offset shadows at 6px and 4px in solid black, no blur, ever.
- Two muted pastel accent surfaces — blush pink and sage green — used as region fills, never as text colors.
- A signature black-pill `label` component (`{components.label}`) — white uppercase text in a small black rectangle — appears as the universal section tag.
- Oversized decorative numerals at 0.15–0.35 opacity sit behind content as wallpaper.
- An arrow glyph (→ with non-breaking space) prepended via `::before` on CTAs and interactive list items.
- No rounded corners anywhere in the system. Every shape is a strict rectangle, square, or circle.
- The system loads zero external fonts; rendering is identical in any browser with default fonts available.

## Colors

### Palette
- **Black** (`{colors.black}` — #0A0A0A): The structural color. All borders, all headline text, all body text, all label fills, all shadow values. Slightly softer than pure #000000 but reads as black at any reasonable size.
- **White** (`{colors.white}` — #FFFFFF): The canvas. Used as the default slide background, the default card background, and the text color inside black surfaces (labels, table headers, the dark stat tile).
- **Pink** (`{colors.pink}` — #F2D4CF): Muted blush. The warm accent surface — region backgrounds, bar fills, stat tile fills. The pastel saturation keeps black text fully legible without inversion.
- **Green** (`{colors.green}` — #E5EDD6): Sage celadon. The cool accent surface — region backgrounds, bar fills, hover-state highlight, alternating cards. Always paired with pink as the two halves of the accent system; rarely appear without each other in the same composition.
- **Gray** (`{colors.gray}` — #F5F5F5): Off-white neutral. Used for table zebra-stripe rows and tertiary card backgrounds where a region needs separation from white without committing to a colored accent.
- **Dark Gray** (`{colors.darkgray}` — #333333): A reserved tertiary text color, present in the token system but used sparingly. Available for de-emphasized text that needs to read softer than pure black.

### Defaults
- **Default surface background**: `{colors.white}`.
- **Default headline color**: `{colors.black}` — always. Headlines never appear in pink, green, or gray; only in black (on light surfaces) or white (on the black surface).
- **Default body text color**: `{colors.black}`.
- **Default border color**: `{colors.black}` — always.
- **Default accent surface for warm regions**: `{colors.pink}`.
- **Default accent surface for cool regions**: `{colors.green}`.
- **Default neutral fill for tertiary regions**: `{colors.gray}`.
- **Default text color on `{colors.black}` surfaces**: `{colors.white}` — the only color inversion in the system.

The accent surfaces (pink, green) are interchangeable — neither has a fixed semantic role (e.g., pink is not "warning" and green is not "success"). Use whichever color contrast best serves the composition. When two accent regions appear adjacent, pair pink with green for warm/cool balance rather than doubling on one color.

## Typography

### Font Family
The entire system runs on the **native system sans-serif stack**: `Segoe UI, system-ui, -apple-system, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif`. No web fonts are loaded. This is intentional — the digital-native aesthetic depends on the type rendering in the user's actual system font, not a downloaded display face. The result is consistent only in spirit, not in exact letterform: a macOS render will look slightly different from a Windows render, and that variability is acceptable inside the system's tolerance.

The weight axis is the entire expressive tool. Display text uses weight 900 (the heaviest), titles use 800, subtitles use 700, body uses 500, with no italic variants and no alternate faces. The contrast between weight 900 uppercase and weight 500 sentence case is the system's primary typographic rhythm.

### Display and Numerical Scale

| Token | Size (clamp) | Weight | Tracking | Use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `{typography.number}` | 64–120px | 900 | -0.04em | Hero numerical stat |
| `{typography.display}` | 48–96px | 900 | -0.02em | Section-opening or cover display |
| `{typography.number-lg}` | 48–80px | 900 | -0.02em | Large decorative or featured numeral |
| `{typography.headline}` | 32–64px | 900 | -0.01em | Primary section headline |
| `{typography.number-md}` | 36–56px | 900 | -0.02em | Stat tile or metric numeral |
| `{typography.title}` | 24–36px | 800 | 0.01em | Region or section title |
| `{typography.subtitle}` | 16–22px | 700 | 0.04em | Subtitle, intra-region heading |
| `{typography.body}` | 16–20px | 500 | 0 | Paragraph body |
| `{typography.caption}` | 11–13px | 700 | 0.08em | Caption, fine print, footnote |
| `{typography.label-text}` | 11px | 800 | 0.08em | Text inside black label pills |

### Defaults
- **Default size for a primary section headline**: `{typography.headline}` (32–64px clamp).
- **Default size for a cover or opening display**: `{typography.display}` (48–96px clamp).
- **Default size for paragraph body**: `{typography.body}` (16–20px clamp).
- **Default size for any inline label or caption**: `{typography.caption}` (11–13px clamp).
- **Default weight for any display element**: 900.
- **Default weight for any body element**: 500.
- **Default size for a hero numerical figure**: `{typography.number}` (64–120px clamp).

When unsure, reach for `{typography.headline}` for the slide's primary text moment, not `{typography.title}` (which is for region-level headings within a slide).

### Signature Treatments
These treatments are **non-optional whenever the corresponding element type is used**:

- **Every display, headline, title, and subtitle element is uppercase.** Sentence-case display type does not exist in this system. If text is `{typography.display}`, `{typography.headline}`, `{typography.title}`, or `{typography.subtitle}`, it must be uppercase.
- **Every body element is sentence case.** Never uppercase a `{typography.body}` element — the uppercase/sentence-case contrast between display and body is the system's typographic signal.
- **Every display element uses negative letter-spacing.** Display (–0.02em), headline (–0.01em), number (–0.04em). Display type with default tracking reads as untreated; the negative tracking is what gives the type its compressed, brutalist density.
- **Every caption and label uses positive letter-spacing of at least 0.06em.** Caption and label glyphs without tracking read as code, not editorial.
- **All numerical figures use weight 900 with negative letter-spacing.** Even small stat numerals (36–56px) follow the display-weight convention.

### Typography Principles
The weight 900 + uppercase + negative tracking combination is the system's primary "voice." Switching any of those three properties (e.g., using weight 700 uppercase, or weight 900 sentence case) reads as a different design system. Weight 800 is reserved for `{typography.title}` and labels; weight 700 is for `{typography.subtitle}` and `{typography.caption}`; weight 500 is for body. Do not use intermediate weights (400, 600) — the weight ladder is fixed.

Italic is not used anywhere in the system. Underline is not used. The only emphasis mechanism is weight contrast.

## Layout

### Canvas System
The system targets `100vw × 100vh` — full viewport. Each `.slide` is absolutely positioned to fill the viewport and only one slide is `display: flex` at a time (slide navigation is JS-driven via keyboard arrow keys, spacebar, and touch swipe). All sizes use CSS `clamp()` so the layout fluidly scales between minimum and maximum without breakpoints.

### Padding and Gap Scale
| Token | Range | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `{spacing.pad-lg}` | 32–64px | Outer slide-region padding, full-region cells |
| `{spacing.pad-md}` | 20–40px | Header bands, secondary regions |
| `{spacing.pad-sm}` | 12–20px | Compact regions, table cells |
| `{spacing.gap-lg}` | 24–48px | Large flex/grid gaps |
| `{spacing.gap-md}` | 16–32px | Standard flex/grid gaps |
| `{spacing.gap-sm}` | 8–16px | Tight inline gaps |

### Border-as-Layout Principle
The defining structural pattern: **regions are separated by 3px solid black borders, not by gaps**. When a slide is divided into a 2-column grid, the two columns share a 3px black vertical border between them and the cells meet that border directly — no `gap` property, no margin. When a header band sits above a content area, a 3px black horizontal line separates them and both regions abut the line. This is the system's most distinctive structural choice.

Internal padding within a region (`{spacing.pad-lg}`, etc.) provides the breathing room inside cells. Gaps between cells do not exist.

## Depth and Elevation

### Hard Offset Shadow (Only Technique)
The system uses exactly two shadow values:
- **`{shadows.default}`** = `6px 6px 0 {colors.black}` — the standard hard offset shadow for elevated elements (large cards, primary callouts).
- **`{shadows.small}`** = `4px 4px 0 {colors.black}` — the lighter offset for smaller elevated elements.

Both shadows are **solid black, zero blur, fixed offset bottom-right**. There is no shadow variation by color, no blurred drop shadow, no soft elevation. An element either casts a hard offset shadow or it casts no shadow.

### Border-Based Depth
Most of the system's apparent "depth" actually comes from borders, not shadows. A 3px solid black border around a card on a colored background reads as elevated regardless of whether the card carries a shadow. Use shadow only when an element needs to feel "lifted off" the surface beneath it — typically a card that overlaps or floats above its containing region.

### Decorative Wallpaper (Atmospheric Depth)
A signature treatment: oversized numerals placed inside a card at very low opacity (0.15 for the largest quote mark, 0.20 for step numerals, 0.35 for card ordinals) sit behind the actual content as decorative wallpaper. The numeral fills the upper-left or upper portion of the region, and the actual title sits in front of it at full opacity. This creates a layered effect — content over decoration — without using any z-index trickery.

## Shapes and Treatment

### Border Radius
| Value | Use |
|---|---|
| 0px | Everything except circles |
| 50% (circle) | Donut chart shapes only |

The system has **no rounded corners**. Cards, buttons, labels, icon boxes, stat tiles, table cells, image frames — all strict rectangles or squares. The only round shape is the SVG donut chart, which is a circle by geometric necessity.

### Border Weights
- **3px solid `{colors.black}`** — the universal border. Used on every structural division: region separators, card outlines, table cells, icon boxes, connector nodes, swatches, bar tracks, stat tile borders. Never thinner, never thicker, never colored, never dashed.
- **4px solid `{colors.black}`** — used only for the `{components.line-h}` and `{components.line-v}` decorative rule elements (60px stub lines).
- **4px solid `{colors.white}`** — used only on the image placeholder frame inside black image regions (inverted border treatment for white-on-black contexts).
- **1.5px stroke** — used only on the inner stroke of the SVG donut chart at 0.1 opacity (a barely-visible inner ring).

### Decorative Element Types

**Black label pill** — A small black rectangle containing white uppercase text at 11px / weight 800 / 0.08em letter-spacing, with 6px × 14px padding. The system's universal section tag, fiscal-year marker, or status chip. May be prepended with the `{components.arrow-prefix}` for CTA variants.

**Horizontal rule stub** — A 60px × 4px solid black rectangle (`{components.line-h}`) used as an inline visual separator or accent next to a label. Functions as a "section break" mark in editorial layouts.

**Icon box** — A 48px × 48px white square with 3px black border containing a 1–3 character glyph (initials, Roman numeral, single letter) at 18–20px weight 900. Used as logo marks and feature icons.

**Decorative oversized numeral** — A large numeric character (typically a step number or section ordinal) at weight 900 placed inside a card at 0.15–0.35 opacity. Sits behind or above the card's actual content as wallpaper.

**Connector node** — A 32px × 32px solid black square containing a white arrow glyph at weight 900. Positioned absolutely between sequential items in a horizontal flow (e.g., between timeline steps). Acts as the visual "→" between stages.

**Bar track** — A 32px-tall horizontal rectangle with 3px black border and white interior. The fill (in pink, green, or black) is a child `div` whose `width` percentage represents the data value, with the value label printed inside the fill at 12px weight 800. Bars in black get inverted text color (white).

**Stat tile** — A bordered card (`{components.stat-box}`) containing a large numeral (`{typography.number-md}`) above a small caption (`{typography.caption}`). Background may be white, pink, green, gray, or black (with appropriate text inversion).

**Arrow-prefixed text** — Text elements (CTAs, interactive list rows) get a `→` (U+2192) prepended via `::before` with a non-breaking space, indicating action or navigation. This is the system's interactivity signal.

**Donut chart** — Multi-segment SVG ring at 24px stroke width with a 1.5px inner divider ring at 0.1 opacity. Segments use the palette colors (black, pink, green) and the center holds a value + label pair.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use 3px solid black borders on every structural division. The border weight is the system's identity — thinner reads as generic web app, thicker reads as broken.
- Set headline color to `{colors.black}` by default. Headlines in pink, green, or gray do not exist in this system.
- Pair pink and green as opposites when two accent surfaces appear together — warm with cool, never two pinks or two greens adjacent.
- Apply uppercase + negative letter-spacing + weight 900 together on every display element. The three traits are inseparable — using them individually loses the brutalist character.
- Use the black label pill (`{components.label}`) as the universal section tag. It is the system's most distinctive small component and should appear generously.
- Use the arrow-prefix (`→ + nbsp`) on every CTA and interactive list row. It is the system's interactivity signal.
- Render shadows as `6px 6px 0 {colors.black}` or `4px 4px 0 {colors.black}`. There are only two shadow values — pick one.
- Place oversized decorative numerals at 0.15–0.35 opacity behind content in cards that have a numerical identity (step number, ordinal, quote mark). The wallpaper-numeral pattern is a system signature.
- Let borders touch directly. Two regions meeting at a 3px black line is correct; a gap between them is wrong.
- Use weight 500 sentence case for body and weight 900 uppercase for display. The contrast between the two is the typographic rhythm.

### Don't
- Don't load any web fonts. The system runs on the native sans-serif stack — Segoe UI / system-ui / Helvetica. Adding Google Fonts breaks the digital-native aesthetic.
- Don't round any corner. Cards, buttons, labels, icon boxes — all strict rectangles. Border-radius is permitted only for circles (the donut chart).
- Don't use blurred shadows. `0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` does not exist here. Either a 4px/6px hard solid black offset or nothing.
- Don't use color on borders. All structural borders are black. A colored border breaks the system.
- Don't use intermediate font weights (400, 600). The weight ladder is fixed at 500 / 700 / 800 / 900.
- Don't use italic or underline. The only emphasis mechanism is weight contrast.
- Don't put display-weight text in sentence case. Uppercase is non-negotiable on display, headline, title, subtitle, and caption tokens.
- Don't introduce a third accent surface color. Pink and green are the only accent surfaces. Adding a yellow or blue card breaks the warm/cool pairing system.
- Don't use gap properties between border-divided regions. Regions meet at borders; they do not have margins between them.
- Don't invert text color over pink, green, or gray surfaces. The pastels are designed for black text on top — inverted treatments only apply to the `{colors.black}` surface.

## Responsive Behavior

Unlike most templates in this library, Raw Grid is **viewport-fluid by design**. The entire system uses CSS `clamp()` for sizes and there is no fixed canvas dimension. Every `font-size`, `padding`, `gap`, and `width` value scales linearly between a minimum and maximum based on viewport width. The same composition renders correctly on a 1280×720 laptop, a 1920×1080 monitor, and a 2560×1440 display without media queries.

### Scaling Behavior
- Display headline scales from 48px at minimum viewport to 96px at maximum.
- Body text scales from 16px to 20px.
- Padding scales from 32px to 64px on `{spacing.pad-lg}`.
- Borders, label pill padding, and shadow offsets are fixed (3px, 6px 14px, 6px 6px) — they do not scale, which means at larger viewports the borders appear proportionally finer.

### Presenter Behavior
- Slides advance via `ArrowDown`, `ArrowRight`, or `Space`.
- Slides go back via `ArrowUp` or `ArrowLeft`.
- `Home` jumps to first, `End` to last.
- Touch swipe (vertical) advances/reverses on mobile.
- The active slide carries the `.active` class; non-active slides are `display: none`.

### Print Behavior
A `@media print` rule sets all slides to `display: flex` with `page-break-after: always` — printing the deck produces a sequential page-per-slide PDF.

### Hover States
The system uniquely has interactive hover states baked into the design — list items and table rows highlight to `{colors.green}` on hover via a 0.15s transition. This is unusual for a presentation system; it reflects Raw Grid's hybrid identity as both presentation and product mockup.

## CJK & International Content

### Recommended Chinese Pairing

| Role | Latin | Chinese | Weight mapping |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display / Headline / Title / Subtitle | Segoe UI / system-ui (900) | **思源黑体 Noto Sans SC** | 900 |
| Body / Caption / Label | Segoe UI / system-ui (500–800) | **思源黑体 Noto Sans SC** | 500 (body), 700–800 (caption / label) |

### Mixed-Content Strategy

**Strategy A — single CJK family across the entire system.** Raw Grid is intentionally a one-family system: every weight (900 / 800 / 700 / 500) comes from the same Latin stack. Mirroring that with a single CJK family — Noto Sans SC — preserves the system's most defining property: typographic uniformity. Because the Latin stack is `system-ui` (Segoe UI on Windows, San Francisco on macOS), pairing with a single high-quality CJK web font keeps the rendering as close to "system-native" as the digital-native aesthetic demands. Using two CJK families would fracture the neobrutalist monoculture.

### Loading

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Noto+Sans+SC:wght@500;700;800;900&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

Then append `'Noto Sans SC'` after the Latin stack in every font-family token:
```css
font-family: 'Segoe UI', system-ui, -apple-system, Helvetica, Arial, 'Noto Sans SC', sans-serif;
```

### Universal CJK Adjustments

- Line-height: body 1.75–1.85, display 1.15–1.25
- Letter-spacing: 0 on CJK
- Text-transform: no uppercase on CJK
- Full-width punctuation
- No period on display headlines
- Pangu spacing (盘古之白): `使用 Codex` not `使用Codex`
- One font per sentence

### Aesthetic Notes for This System

- **The negative tracking that defines the Latin display voice does not transfer.** Set `letter-spacing: 0` on every CJK display element. Noto Sans SC at weight 900 already reads as dense and brutalist; negative tracking will jam glyphs together and read as a rendering bug, not as a design choice.
- **Uppercase is the entire Latin display voice — and it does not exist in Chinese.** Compensate by leaning harder on the weight contrast (900 display vs. 500 body) and on the label pill's white-on-black inversion. The brutalist density comes from the weight ladder, not from case.
- **The black label pill (`{components.label}`) survives the translation beautifully.** A 2–4 character Chinese label (品牌, 信号源, 第四季度) in Noto Sans SC 800 reads as more compact and arguably more striking than the English equivalent.
- **Decorative oversized numerals at 0.15–0.35 opacity should stay Latin** (Arabic numerals look correct in this system; full-width Chinese numerals 零一二三 do not carry the same wallpaper-numeral signal).
- **The arrow-prefix (`→`) renders identically in CJK contexts** and is the right interactivity signal for both languages.

### Known CJK Gap

Raw Grid's whole aesthetic argument is "this is the user's actual system font, not a downloaded display face." Loading Noto Sans SC technically violates that purity — but there is no acceptable substitute. macOS ships PingFang SC and Windows ships Microsoft YaHei, but the two render at noticeably different weights at "900," and the digital-native aesthetic depends on weight 900 reading consistently. Noto Sans SC is the smallest acceptable concession to web fonts; treat it as the one exception to the no-web-fonts rule, only for CJK content.

## Iteration Guide

1. Any new structural region uses a 3px solid black border to separate from its neighbor. Never use a gap or a margin between regions — borders are the separators.
2. Any new card or panel inherits the bordered-rectangle pattern: 3px solid black border, square corners, padding from the `{spacing.pad-*}` scale, background from the palette (white, pink, green, gray, or black).
3. Any new headline uses `{typography.headline}` (or `{typography.display}` for cover-level moments) in `{colors.black}` with uppercase. Don't reach for `{typography.title}` for the primary moment — that's a sub-headline.
4. Any new label or chip uses the `{components.label}` pattern: black background, white uppercase text at 11px / weight 800 / 0.08em.
5. Any new numerical figure follows the weight-900 + negative-tracking convention. Stat tiles use `{typography.number-md}`; hero stats use `{typography.number}`.
6. Any new accent surface picks pink or green based on warm/cool need. Don't introduce a third color.
7. Any new CTA or interactive element gets the `→` arrow prefix and, if elevated, a `6px 6px 0 {colors.black}` shadow.
8. If a card needs a "personality" element, add an oversized decorative numeral at 0.15–0.35 opacity rather than a graphic or icon. The wallpaper-numeral treatment is the system's signature decorative move.
9. Tables follow the bordered-cells + zebra-stripe + black-header pattern. Don't restyle them — the brutalist table aesthetic is part of the system identity.

## Known Gaps

- The `--darkgray` (#333333) CSS variable is defined but not actively used in any rule. It is available as a reserved tertiary text color but not deployed anywhere in the source.
- The system loads no external fonts — the rendered letterforms will differ between operating systems. macOS renders system-ui as San Francisco, Windows renders Segoe UI, Linux renders whatever sans-serif is configured. This visual inconsistency is by design but is worth noting.
- Hover states (list items → green, table rows → green) are interactive web behaviors that have no analog in print or static export. Treat them as bonus interactivity, not core design system.
- The slide navigation JavaScript is embedded inline — it handles keyboard, touch, and the active-class system. Any new slide must follow the `<div class="slide sN">` pattern and respect the `current` index.
- The SVG donut chart uses hardcoded `stroke-dasharray` values that must be computed manually based on segment percentages and the chart's 80px radius circumference (~502.4). There is no data-binding layer.
- The image placeholder on image-paired regions is just a 4px-white-bordered div with "[ Image Placeholder ]" text — actual image insertion requires replacing the placeholder div with an `<img>` and matching the parent background to the image's negative space.
- The `.s5-image-placeholder` includes the word "Cohots" (sic) which appears to be a typo for "Cohorts" in the source. Flag this when reusing content.

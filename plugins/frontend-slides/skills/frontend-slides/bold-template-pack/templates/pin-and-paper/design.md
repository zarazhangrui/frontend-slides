name: Pin & Paper
description: A field-notebook editorial system rendered as yellow legal-pad paper with deep cobalt-blue ink. Every slide carries a fractalnoise paper-grain overlay, hand-drawn safety-pin SVG illustrations that "pin" cards to the page, and a hand-script Caveat face for personal annotations. Space Grotesk at heavy weights carries the printed headlines; DM Mono handles archival labels. The aesthetic borrows from analog field reports, vintage public-notice boards, and the diary pages of scientific notebooks — closer to a lab journal pinned to a corkboard than a polished deck.

## Frontend Slides Fixed-Stage Policy

When this design system is used by the `frontend-slides` skill, generate the final deck as a **fixed 1920×1080 stage** that scales uniformly to the browser viewport. The deck should preserve a 16:9 slide canvas on every screen, including phones; it may letterbox or pillarbox, but it should not reflow slide content for mobile.

This policy has higher priority than any source-template responsive behavior described later in this file. If a later section says the original template is viewport-fluid, treat that as source history only, not as the target generation model for `frontend-slides`.

This policy applies even if the source template was originally implemented with viewport-fluid CSS such as `100vw`, `100vh`, `vw`, `vh`, or `clamp()`. Treat those values as design proportions to translate into 1920×1080 stage coordinates, not as live responsive rules in the generated deck.

Use `deck-stage.js` or an equivalent inline stage scaler for final output: render each slide at 1920×1080, scale the whole stage with one transform, and verify rendered screenshots for both text overflow and panel overlap.


## Overview

Pin & Paper is a **field-notebook editorial system** built on a single material premise: every slide is yellow legal-pad paper. The paper is rendered through a base color (`{colors.paper}` — saturated cadmium yellow), two soft radial-gradient highlights (upper-left light, lower-right shadow), and a non-optional fractal-noise grain overlay on a `::before` pseudo-element with multiply blend. This stack creates a surface that reads as physical paper under raking light. Without the grain, the system collapses into flat cartoon-yellow; the texture is foundational, not decorative.

The typeface stack is a deliberate three-voice editorial pairing. **Space Grotesk** at weight 600–700 carries every printed headline and display moment — its tight geometric character at heavy weights reads as a poster or notice-board printout. **Caveat** (a hand-script face) carries every handwritten moment: marginalia, "me" voice annotations, step numerals, pill labels, oversized script ordinals. Caveat is the system's personal-voice mechanism — wherever script appears, the tone shifts from "official notice" to "handwritten note in the margin." **DM Mono** at weight 500 carries every archival metadata tag: top-chrome brand lockup, footer meta, source attribution, axis labels. The three voices — print headline, handwritten note, archival catalog tag — are non-overlapping, and the system's editorial rhythm depends on them staying in their lanes.

The palette is anchored to a yellow-and-blue complementary pair. **Paper yellow** (`{colors.paper}` and its three close variants) is every surface. **Ink blue** (`{colors.ink}` — a deep cobalt #1F3A8A) is every text moment, every border, every divider, every pin illustration. **Cream** (`{colors.cream}`) is the card background — a calmer off-white-ivory tone that lets cards visually recede from the loud yellow page. **Cinnabar red** (`{colors.red}` — #C2342B) is used in two specific roles only: the rotated rubber-stamp component and the negative-state pill. Red is never used as text, fill, or border outside these two roles. Tertiary colors (olive, orange, kraft) exist in the token list but are not actively deployed in the source.

Depth is created through a single signature mechanism: **the hard offset shadow**. Every card carries a `5px 6px 0 0 {colors.ink}` (or `4px 5px 0 0`, or `8px 9px 0 0` for the largest quote panel) — a solid ink-blue rectangle offset down and to the right with zero blur. This shadow plus the 4px micro-radius corner plus the 1.5px ink border defines the universal card pattern. Cards look pinned and slightly lifted from the page; the hard offset is the system's only depth language.

**Density philosophy: medium-dense, populated.** Pin & Paper reads as authoritative when its cards are pinned across the page in a clear arrangement — typically 3 to 6 cards per slide, each carrying a heading, a body block, and often a handwritten marginal annotation. A slide with one centered headline and otherwise empty space reads as broken — the system was designed as a populated field-notebook page, and a notebook page that's mostly blank reads as incomplete. Cards should be filled; pins should appear; the handwritten layer should add a marginal note in at least half the slides. The exception is the cover and section-divider slides, which are sparser by convention but compensate with oversized display type (196px) and large pin illustrations.

**Key Characteristics:**
- Yellow paper background (`{components.paper-surface}`) with two layered radial gradients and a non-optional fractal-noise grain overlay (`{components.paper-grain-overlay}`) on every slide.
- Deep cobalt-blue ink (`{colors.ink}`) as the universal text, border, divider, and pin-illustration color.
- Cream card surfaces (`{colors.cream}`) with 1.5px ink borders, 4px micro-radius, and **a hard ink-blue offset shadow** (5px–6px, zero blur).
- Hand-drawn safety-pin SVG illustrations (`{components.pin-illustration}`) — closed and open variants — pinned to cards at slight rotation angles.
- Three-voice typography: Space Grotesk for print headlines, Caveat hand-script for personal voice, DM Mono for archival labels.
- A signature cinnabar-red rotated rubber stamp (`{components.stamp}`) for status marks (CONFIDENTIAL, RECEIVED, etc.).
- 4px micro-radius on every card; pills go full 999px.
- Slight panel rotation (0.6 to 1.5 degrees) on alternating cards for the "pinned-askew" effect.

## Colors

### Palette

- **Paper Yellow** (`{colors.paper}` — #EFE56A): The dominant surface color. Saturated cadmium yellow. Combined with the layered radial gradients and grain overlay, this is what makes the slide read as physical paper.
- **Paper Light** (`{colors.paper-2}` — #F5ECA0): Lighter, less saturated yellow. Used as an alternate card fill to break adjacent same-tone cards.
- **Paper Deep** (`{colors.paper-3}` — #E8D85A): Deeper, more saturated yellow. Used on the `.deep` slide variant for higher-contrast moments.
- **Paper Extra** (`{colors.paper-extra}` — #FBE6A4): Warm yellow with a hint of cream, used as the most differentiated card variant — often paired with a slight rotation.
- **Cream** (`{colors.cream}` — #F8F1D6): The card background. A soft off-white ivory that lets cards recede from the loud yellow page. Used on every standard card surface.
- **Kraft** (`{colors.kraft}` — #C9A66B): A warm tan/kraft tone. Defined in the token system but not actively used in the source.
- **Ink Blue** (`{colors.ink}` — #1F3A8A): Deep cobalt navy. The universal text, border, divider, pin illustration, and shadow color. The system's structural identity.
- **Ink Soft** (`{colors.ink-soft}` — #2D4FB8): A slightly lighter cobalt variant; available but rarely used.
- **Ink Line** (`{colors.ink-line}` — #3457C4): A slightly brighter cobalt for line decorations; rarely used.
- **Ink Deep** (`{colors.ink-deep}` — #0E1430): Near-black with a slight blue cast. Used for the `.ink` slide variant background.
- **Cinnabar Red** (`{colors.red}` — #C2342B): The stamp color and the negative-pill border/text color. Used only in two roles — never as a general accent.
- **Olive** (`{colors.olive}`) and **Orange** (`{colors.orange}`): Defined but inactive. Available as reserved tertiary tones.

### Defaults

- **Default slide surface**: `{components.paper-surface}` — yellow paper with layered gradients. Always.
- **Default surface grain**: `{components.paper-grain-overlay}` at opacity 0.35 with multiply blend. Non-optional.
- **Default primary headline color**: `{colors.ink}` on yellow surfaces; `{colors.paper}` on ink surfaces.
- **Default body text color**: `{colors.ink}` on yellow/cream; `{colors.paper}` on ink (with `opacity: 0.85` for muted lead).
- **Default card surface**: `{colors.cream}`. Reach for `{colors.paper-2}` or `{colors.paper-extra}` to break up adjacent same-tone cards.
- **Default border color**: `{colors.ink}` at 1.5px. Always.
- **Default shadow**: `5px 6px 0 0 {colors.ink}` (hard offset, zero blur). Smaller cards may use `4px 5px 0 0`; the largest quote panel uses `8px 9px 0 0`.
- **Default label / metadata color**: `{colors.ink}` at opacity 0.65–0.75 for chrome and footer.
- **Default scribble / handwritten color**: `{colors.ink}`. Caveat is always ink-blue on yellow.
- **Default stamp color**: `{colors.red}` — the only routine use of red.

Cream is the card fill; yellow is the page fill. Mixing these breaks the visual hierarchy: a yellow card on a yellow page disappears; a cream card on a cream page collapses the layered-paper reading.

## Typography

### Font Family

The system loads three web fonts: **Space Grotesk** (weights 400, 500, 600, 700) carries all printed display and body type; **Caveat** (weights 500, 600, 700) carries all handwritten / personal-voice moments; **DM Mono** (weights 400, 500) carries all archival metadata.

The emotional register of each face is distinct and load-bearing:
- Space Grotesk reads as **printed, official, typeset** — the voice of the document itself.
- Caveat reads as **handwritten, personal, a note in the margin** — the voice of the person reading the document.
- DM Mono reads as **archival, catalog-card, indexical** — the voice of the system filing the document.

A key inline mixing rule: **a `<small>` element nested inside a Caveat number switches to a smaller Caveat at 60px** for unit suffixes (like `M`, `×`, `%`). The handwritten suffix preserves the hand-counted feeling of the parent numeral.

A second inline mixing rule: **a `.underline` span inside Caveat scribble text gets a 2px solid ink-blue underline** — used to mimic an underline drawn by hand for emphasis.

### Defaults

- **Default primary content headline**: `{typography.h2}` (96px Space Grotesk 700).
- **Default cover / opening headline**: `{typography.display-mega}` (196px).
- **Default section-break headline**: `{typography.display-section}` (168px), used on the ink-blue slide variant.
- **Default body paragraph size**: `{typography.body}` (22px). For dense multi-card slides, drop to `{typography.body-sm}` (19px).
- **Default card heading**: `{typography.card-h3}` (38px) for standard cards; `{typography.card-h3-sm}` (28px) for sub-cards.
- **Default stat figure**: `{typography.display-stat}` (168px) — with a Caveat `<small>` suffix for unit (M, %, ×).
- **Default label / chrome size**: `{typography.label-top}` (18px) for the top chrome; `{typography.label-footer}` (15px) for the bottom.
- **Default handwritten annotation size**: `{typography.scribble-sm}` (38px) for marginal notes; `{typography.scribble-lg}` (70px) for step numerals.
- **Default weight for any display element**: 700.
- **Default weight for body**: 400.

When unsure, the canonical card composition is: a 38px Space Grotesk card heading + a 22px Space Grotesk body paragraph + a 32px Caveat handwritten note at the bottom. That three-layer typography rhythm (print headline, print body, handwritten margin note) is the system's most recognizable internal pattern.

### Signature Treatments

These treatments are **non-optional whenever the corresponding element type is used**:

- **Every slide carries the paper-grain overlay (`{components.paper-grain-overlay}`).** Without it, the paper aesthetic collapses. The grain is part of the surface, not a decorative flourish.
- **Every card carries a 1.5px solid ink border, 4px border-radius, AND a hard ink-blue offset shadow (5–8px offset, zero blur).** All three together — missing the shadow makes the card feel un-pinned; missing the border makes it feel un-printed.
- **Caveat is always ink-blue** (`{colors.ink}`) on yellow/cream surfaces, and always paper-yellow on ink surfaces. Caveat in any other color does not exist.
- **Pin illustrations (`{components.pin-illustration}`) are always rotated off-axis** (typical range: -14° to +20°). A pin rendered at 0° rotation breaks the hand-pinned aesthetic.
- **The stamp component (`{components.stamp}`) is always rotated -4°** with a 3px solid red border, red mono text, and zero radius. Stamp text is always DM Mono uppercase.
- **Every Space Grotesk display headline uses negative letter-spacing** in the -0.02 to -0.04em range. Tighter for larger sizes.
- **Hand-script numerals (Caveat at 60–70px) are the only step-numbering mechanism** in process diagrams and ordered CTA lists. Don't substitute Space Grotesk numerals.
- **The top-chrome lockup includes the inline `#mark` SVG glyph** alongside the brand text. The glyph is part of the brand identity, not optional.

### Typography Principles

The rhythm of Pin & Paper is **printed headline + printed body + handwritten margin note + mono archival tag** — four voices, each in its assigned face. Switching any voice (e.g., setting a marginal note in Space Grotesk, or a body paragraph in Caveat) collapses the system's editorial register.

Italic letterforms are not used. Underline is used only on `.underline` spans inside Caveat scribble text (2px solid ink). Bold inside body is rare; emphasis is achieved either by switching to a heavier Space Grotesk weight at a larger size, or by adding a Caveat handwritten annotation below.

## Layout

### Canvas System

The system targets a **fixed 1920×1080 canvas** rendered inside a `<deck-stage>` web component. All sizes are pixel-fixed; the stage handles proportional scaling to the browser viewport.

Most slides use **absolute positioning** with edge-anchored elements (`left: 64px`, `right: 64px`, `top: 110px`, `bottom: 100px`) for the content stage, plus targeted grid layouts for card rows. Pin illustrations are absolutely-positioned overlays on top of card stacks.

### Padding and Anchoring

| Anchor | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `pad-edge` | 64px | Left and right edge insets on every slide |
| `pad-top` | 110px | Top inset for content (below the 44px top chrome) |
| `pad-bottom` | 90px | Bottom inset for content (above the 36px footer chrome) |
| `grid-gap-sm` | 22px | Process card gap |
| `grid-gap-md` | 28px | Notice / stats card gap |
| `grid-gap-lg` | 32px | Notecard grid gap |

Cards typically use `28px–36px` internal padding on the top and `22px–28px` on the sides, with `22px–28px` on the bottom.

### Chrome Frame

Every slide carries a **top chrome band** at 44px top / 64px sides — a brand lockup on the left (with inline #mark SVG glyph) and a meta-tag pair on the right. The chrome is DM Mono uppercase at 18px with 0.12em tracking.

Every slide also carries a **footer chrome** at 36px bottom / 64px sides — typically a source attribution on the left and a page-position marker on the right. The footer is DM Mono uppercase at 15px with 0.14em tracking at 65% opacity.

On ink-blue slides, both chromes flip color to `{colors.paper}` and the grain overlay shifts to opacity 0.25 with screen blend mode.

## Depth and Elevation

### Hard Offset Shadow (Primary Depth)

The system's only depth treatment is the **hard ink-blue offset shadow** on every card: `5px 6px 0 0 {colors.ink}` (standard), `4px 5px 0 0` (compact), `6px 7px 0 0 rgba(239,229,106,.25)` (chart-card with yellow-tinted shadow), or `8px 9px 0 0` (the largest quote panel). The shadow is always solid, always offset down-right, always zero blur. There are no blurred drop shadows anywhere in the system.

### Paper Texture Depth

The fractal-noise grain (`{components.paper-grain-overlay}`) at opacity 0.35 with multiply blend adds a subtle perceived depth — the texture creates micro-variation that reads as paper fiber. This is depth at the surface level, not at the element level.

### Pin Illustrations as Depth Signal

The hand-drawn safety-pin SVGs positioned at the top edge of cards (typically `position: absolute; top: -14 to -22px; left: 28–90px; transform: rotate(-6 to -12deg)`) create the visual illusion that the card has been pinned to the page. The pin is the depth narrative: a pin appearing at the top of a card explains why the card has a shadow and a rotation.

### Slight Rotation on Alternate Cards

Some card variants (`{components.pinned-card-alt2}`) carry a slight rotation (`transform: rotate(0.6deg)` to `rotate(1.5deg)`) that reads as a sheet of paper pinned slightly askew. This is a deliberate imperfection — used sparingly (one or two cards per slide), not on every card.

## Shapes and Treatment

### Border Radius

| Value | Use |
|---|---|
| 0px | Stamp, pin glyphs, page numbers |
| 4px | Cards, panels, table containers, image wrappers — the system's micro-radius |
| 999px | Pills only |

The system uses a **4px micro-radius** on every card — small enough to read as "printed corner with slight bleed" rather than rounded UI. Pills are the only round shape; pills with the unusual treatment of Caveat handwritten letterforms inside.

### Border Weights

- **1.5px solid `{colors.ink}`** — the universal card border. Used on every cream card, every table container, every panel.
- **1.5px dashed rgba(31,58,138,.45)** — used as a dotted separator between agenda rows, between CTA steps, and at the top of source notes inside cards. Adds the "graph-paper line break" feel.
- **3px solid `{colors.red}`** — used only on the stamp component (`{components.stamp}`).
- **2px solid `{colors.ink}`** — used only on the Caveat `.underline` span treatment.

### Decorative Element Types

**Pin illustration (`{components.pin-illustration}`)** — The defining visual signature. A hand-drawn safety-pin SVG (two variants: closed and open) rendered in `currentColor` and rotated at a slight angle. Pins appear at the top of cards, as decorative overlays on the cover, as oversized accent illustrations on section dividers (up to 640px wide), and pinned to agenda rows. The pin is the system's voice — wherever a pin appears, the page reads as a pinned document.

**Stamp (`{components.stamp}`)** — A cinnabar-red rotated rubber-stamp tag with 3px solid red border, red mono uppercase text, and -4° rotation. Used for status marks (CONFIDENTIAL, RECEIVED). The stamp is one of the two roles where red is used in this system.

**Scribble (`{components.scribble}`)** — A Caveat hand-script text block, often rotated -1.5° to -3° for the "handwritten" feel. Used for marginal notes, "me" voice annotations, large script accents. May include `.underline` spans for handwritten emphasis.

**Pinned card (`{components.pinned-card}`)** — The universal card pattern: cream fill, 1.5px ink border, 4px micro-radius, 5–6px hard ink offset shadow. Often carries a pin illustration overlapping its top edge. Three alternate fill colors break up adjacent same-tone cards.

**Top chrome lockup** — The brand text accompanied by an inline #mark SVG glyph (a circle on the right with an arrow shaft pointing left). The glyph is part of the brand's identity.

**Dashed border separators** — Used as inter-row dividers in agenda lists, CTA step lists, and inside cards as source-attribution separators. Always `1.5px dashed rgba(31,58,138,.45)`.

**Caveat pills (`{components.pill-yes}`, `{components.pill-part}`)** — Pills with hand-script letterforms inside (Caveat 28px) on solid or paper-tone fills. The mismatch between rounded UI shape and handwritten text is intentional.

**Process / CTA script numerals** — Caveat 60–70px ordinals inside cards or list rows. The hand-script number signals "step counted by hand, not by an algorithm."

**Oversized script quote-mark** — A Caveat at 360px rendered as the opening glyph on the quote slide. The script size pushes into the realm of decoration; the glyph is so large that it functions as composition, not punctuation.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Apply the paper-grain overlay (`{components.paper-grain-overlay}`) to every slide. The texture is foundational to the paper reading.
- Set every card with the universal pattern: 1.5px ink border + 4px radius + hard ink offset shadow. The three together define the card.
- Use Space Grotesk weight 700 in mixed case (with negative letter-spacing) for every printed headline.
- Use Caveat for every handwritten or personal-voice moment — marginal notes, step numerals, pill text. The script is the system's "me" voice.
- Use DM Mono uppercase at 0.12–0.18em tracking for every archival tag, chrome label, and footer string.
- Rotate every pin illustration off-axis (typical range -14° to +20°). A pin at 0° rotation breaks the hand-pinned aesthetic.
- Populate cards. The system reads as authoritative when 3–6 cards are pinned across the page, each with heading + body + marginal note.
- Use the rotated stamp component (`{components.stamp}`) for status marks. The -4° rotation is its identity.
- Pair a Caveat step numeral with a Space Grotesk card heading inside process and CTA lists. The script numeral is the system's ordering voice.
- Use a slight rotation (0.6° to 1.5°) on one card per slide for the "pinned-askew" effect. Don't rotate every card.

### Don't
- Don't omit the paper-grain overlay. Without it, the surface collapses into flat cartoon-yellow.
- Don't substitute a different list marker for the Caveat hand-script numeral. Step numbers are always hand-script.
- Don't use red outside the stamp and the negative pill. Red is a two-role accent only.
- Don't render pin illustrations at 0° rotation. The off-axis tilt is what makes them read as physical pins.
- Don't use blurred shadows. Cards use hard ink-blue offset shadows only.
- Don't fill a card with yellow on the yellow page surface. Cards are cream; the contrast between cream cards and yellow page is the layered-paper signal.
- Don't put body copy in Caveat. The hand-script is for marginal notes and accents, never paragraphs.
- Don't put headline copy in DM Mono. Mono is the archival voice, not the editorial voice.
- Don't use radius larger than 4px on cards. The micro-radius is the printed-corner signal; larger radius collapses into generic UI.
- Don't compose a near-empty slide. The system was designed as a populated notebook page; sparseness reads as broken.

## Responsive Behavior

The system targets a **fixed 1920×1080 canvas** rendered inside a `<deck-stage>` web component (loaded via `deck-stage.js`). The stage handles proportional scaling to the browser viewport — all pixel-fixed sizes inside the canvas scale uniformly.

### Presenter Behavior
- The `<deck-stage>` component manages navigation, scaling, and presenter chrome.
- Keyboard, touch, and mouse-wheel navigation are handled by the stage component.
- The slide canvas is constant 1920×1080 regardless of viewport size.

### Print Behavior
Print export depends on the deck-stage component's print handling. The fractal-noise grain overlay may not render in all PDF exports — test before assuming texture transfers.

## CJK & International Content

### Recommended Chinese Pairing

| Role | Latin face | Chinese face | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| Display / headline (Space Grotesk 700) | Space Grotesk | 龙藏体 Long Cang | 400 (only weight available) |
| Body (Space Grotesk 400) | Space Grotesk | 霞鹜文楷 LXGW WenKai | 400 |
| Handwritten / scribble (Caveat) | Caveat | 龙藏体 Long Cang | 400 |
| Label / mono (DM Mono UPPERCASE tracked) | DM Mono | 霞鹜文楷 LXGW WenKai | 400 (do not force monospace on CJK) |

### Mixed-Content Strategy

Strategy A — extend each token's `fontFamily` to include the Chinese face after the Latin face. Space Grotesk display tokens become `"Space Grotesk, Long Cang, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif"`; Space Grotesk body tokens become `"Space Grotesk, LXGW WenKai, Helvetica Neue, Arial, sans-serif"`; Caveat tokens become `"Caveat, Long Cang, cursive"`. Latin glyphs render in the original face; CJK falls through automatically.

### Universal CJK Adjustments

- Line-height: body 1.75–1.85, display 1.15–1.25
- Letter-spacing: 0 on CJK
- Text-transform: no uppercase on CJK
- Full-width punctuation （，。：；！？「」（））
- No period on display headlines (Chinese typography convention)
- Pangu spacing 盘古之白 (space between CJK and Latin: `使用 Codex` not `使用Codex`)
- One font per sentence

### Aesthetic Notes for This System

Pin & Paper is the strongest fit for Chinese in this entire library. The yellow legal-pad surface, the cobalt ink, the safety-pin illustrations, and the field-notebook register all translate naturally into Chinese — the system reads as a 笔记本 / 手账 page in either script.

**龙藏体 Long Cang** is a hard-pen handwritten Chinese face — the brushless, ballpoint-on-paper equivalent of Chinese handwriting. It is the perfect Chinese substitute for the Space Grotesk + Caveat dual-role headline-and-scribble voices in this system. Long Cang at large sizes (96–168px) reads as a confident handwritten field-note headline — exactly what Pin & Paper is trying to evoke. Use it for both display headlines and the Caveat-equivalent scribble layer. Layering two visually-distinct hand-script faces in pure Chinese is unnecessary; Long Cang carries both roles.

**霞鹜文楷 LXGW WenKai** is a kaishu-derived body face designed for screen reading — it carries the warmth and slight irregularity of handwritten 楷书 but stays legible at body sizes (18–22px). It is the strongest counterweight to Long Cang's handwritten display and matches the system's "field-notebook personal voice" register exactly. Set every Chinese body paragraph in LXGW WenKai 400.

The pin illustrations, the rotated red stamp, the cream cards with hard ink offset shadows — all transfer unchanged. The Caveat pill component (handwritten letters inside a rounded pill) translates to Long Cang inside the same pill shape and reads as charmingly hand-counted in Chinese.

The system's most recognizable rhythm (printed headline + printed body + handwritten margin note) becomes (Long Cang headline + LXGW WenKai body + Long Cang margin note in a slightly different size). The voice distinction in pure Chinese comes from size, rotation, and color rather than from face swap — Long Cang at 38px rotated -3° in the margin reads clearly as "marginal annotation" against Long Cang at 96px upright in the headline.

DM Mono uppercase tracked labels do not transfer to CJK. Chinese metadata in the top chrome should use LXGW WenKai 400 mixed case with letter-spacing 0. Pure Latin metadata (date strings, source URLs) stays in DM Mono.

### Known CJK Gap

Long Cang and LXGW WenKai are visually adjacent — both carry handwritten kaishu DNA. The three-voice editorial pairing (print / handwritten / archival) collapses into a two-voice pairing in pure Chinese (handwritten-display / handwritten-body / archival-Latin-only). This is not a bug — pure-Chinese decks in Pin & Paper read as more uniformly hand-touched than their Latin counterparts, which is actually closer to the field-notebook aesthetic the system aims for.

## Iteration Guide

1. Every new slide background is the paper-surface (`{components.paper-surface}`) with the grain overlay on `::before`. Don't skip the texture.
2. Every new card uses the universal pattern: cream fill, 1.5px ink border, 4px radius, hard ink offset shadow. Don't customize.
3. Every new headline is Space Grotesk weight 700 mixed case with negative letter-spacing. Don't reach for a different weight.
4. Every new step numeral or ordered-list marker is Caveat hand-script at 60–70px. Don't substitute a numeric font.
5. Every new label or metadata tag is DM Mono uppercase with 0.12–0.18em tracking.
6. Every new pin illustration is rotated off-axis. Choose closed (#pin) for a "secured" feel; open (#pin-open) for a "lifted" feel.
7. To add personal voice to a card, append a Caveat marginal note at the bottom — usually with a `.underline` span for handwritten emphasis.
8. To mark a card with status, place the stamp component (`{components.stamp}`) at a slight rotation in the upper area of the card.
9. To break up adjacent same-tone cards, alternate between cream, paper-2, and paper-extra fills. Add a slight rotation on one card for variety.
10. To use the ink-blue surface variant (e.g., a section divider), flip text color to `{colors.paper}` and reduce grain opacity to 0.25 with screen blend mode.

## Known Gaps

- The system depends on a `<deck-stage>` web component loaded via `deck-stage.js`. Without it, the 1920×1080 canvas will not scale and slides will render at native pixel size.
- The pin illustrations are embedded as inline SVG symbol definitions at the top of the document. New slides that need pin illustrations must reference them via `<use href="#pin">` or `<use href="#pin-open">` — and the symbol definitions must be present in the document.
- The fractal-noise grain overlay uses a data-URI SVG with `feTurbulence`. Some browsers (especially older Safari versions) may render the noise inconsistently or skip it during PDF export.
- The Caveat font carries hand-script ligatures and may render inconsistently between operating systems. Default fallback is `cursive` which varies wildly across systems.
- The `kraft`, `olive`, and `orange` color tokens are defined but inactive in the source. They are reserved for future extension but have no current role.
- The pill-yes component uses Caveat letterforms inside a rounded pill shape — this is intentionally unusual but may read as a UI bug to viewers unfamiliar with the system.
- The paper-grain overlay uses `mix-blend-mode: multiply` on standard slides and `mix-blend-mode: screen` on ink slides. The blend mode flip is essential — using multiply on the dark ink slide turns the slide muddy.
- The bar chart and line chart components use SVG with manually-positioned points. There is no data-binding layer.
- The hand-drawn pin SVG is a fixed-path illustration. Re-coloring works via `currentColor`, but the pin proportions cannot be adjusted without editing the SVG path data.
